This is a very bare-bones prototype of an XCEDE web service.
None of the functions have been formalized, just examples that
I have been able to cobble together in a short period of time.

To run this, edit the "run.sh" script to point to your java
executable (Sun version 1.5 or newer), and then run:

  ./run.sh

from within the XCEDE2WS root directory.  Hopefully the class
path is set up correctly.  You can look at the Makefile to see
how it was compiled.  (In a hurry, obviously.)

The available functions are:

  get_function_list
  get_full_XCEDE
  apply_xpath (the "xcede:" prefix is mapped to the XCEDE 2.0 namespace)

The document (such as it is) for each function is in the
src/org/xcede/XCEDE2WS directory, in HTML files with the
name func_FUNCNAME.html.  They are also included in the
"documentation" field when you call the get_function_list
function.

The "get_function_list" function uses reflection to find the
methods in the org.xcede.XCEDE2WS.WebService class that start
with "func_" and exports them via the service.

The service operates on port 8182 and is accessed using simple URLs.
If you have "curl", you can do this:

  curl http://localhost:8182/get_function_list

  curl http://localhost:8182/get_full_XCEDE

  curl http://localhost:8182/apply_xpath?xpath=/xcede:XCEDE

  curl http://localhost:8182/apply_xpath?xpath=//xcede:subject

  curl 'http://localhost:8182/apply_xpath?xpath=//xcede:subject%5B%40ID=1%5D'
      (that's //xcede:subject[ID=1] unescaped)

  curl 'http://localhost:8182/apply_xpath?xpath=//xcede:event%5Bxcede:value%5B%40name="tonebin"%5D=2%5D'
      (that's //xcede:event[xcede:value[@name="tonebin"]=2] unescaped)
