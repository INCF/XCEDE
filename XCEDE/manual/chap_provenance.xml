  <title>Provenance</title>

  <para>Provenance is used to record in detail the sequence of processing and analysis 
steps that have been executed to create a derived image and/or measures. 
These details include the name and type of machine on which the executable was run, 
the name of the executable, and input parameters to the exectuable.</para>

    <title>Overview</title>
  <para>XCEDE-represented studies will be populated with large numbers of medical image volumes which 
researchers will wish to access and run various processing tools on in order to obtain 
derived data. This derived data, such as volumes of various brain structures, cortical thickness etc., 
will then be placed back into the database, linked to the original volume from which it was produced.
 If a researcher would like to recreate the processing steps, in order to apply it to a new data set,
 they will be able to obtain the information needed to download or reconstruct the tools that were 
used on the original data set. Information about the processing tools needs to be made available by 
the authors of the tools, is collected at run time by the processing scripts, and written into XCDED.
